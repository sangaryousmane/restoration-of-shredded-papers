# restoration-of-shredded-papers

Splicing the shredded paper entails using technology to create a specific algorithm for splicing and recovering the original paper. This repository contains the code that presents an algorithm for splicing shredded paper based on texture matching. By means of this algorithm, we modeled the problem of splicing the shredded paper. And we used the algorithm to splice both pieces of English- and Chinese-shredded paper.
